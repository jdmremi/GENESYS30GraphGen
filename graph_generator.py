# graph_generator.py

# Requires python 3.9.13 to be installed, as well as the matplotlib library.
# matplotlib can be installed by running 'pip3 install matplotlib'

# When the program runs, you will be asked to give the FULL path to your data set. E.g C:\Users\User\Documents\GENESYS30Data on Windows (or wherever your files are located).
# On Mac, the format is generally /users/User/Documents/Desktop/GENESYS30Data, or again, wherever your files are located.

# If done correctly, it should display the amount of files that are in that directory (should be 48 if your trials were conducted correctly)
# Next, the program will visit each file. It will print out the max absorption and wavelength recorded, and print that out so that you know which trial belongs to each file.
# It will also print the name of the file.

# Choose a good name to name the file - e.g "Phenol Red pH 2 Trial 1", because this will also be the title on the graph.
# Steps repeat for every file (48 times, sorry)
# Files will output to the GENESYS30Data/images directory
